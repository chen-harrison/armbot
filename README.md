# Rexarm

The Rexarm project is one of three projects I took part in for the Robotic Systems Laboratory course (ROB 550) at the University of Michigan. The objective was to program a 4-DOF robot manipulator that could use an overhead Kinect sensor to move and stack blocks based on color, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the project was cut short. Our team was still able to implement a majority of the desired functionality, however, which I would like to share here. Thanks to teammates Preeti Kannapan and Niraj Patel for their work on the project.
